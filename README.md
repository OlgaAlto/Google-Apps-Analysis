Google Apps Analysis.

Android is the dominant mobile operating system today. The Google Play Store is the largest and most popular Android app store.

The purpose of my project was to gather and analyze detailed information on apps in the Google Play Store in order to provide insights on  the most downloaded and popular apps; make a regression analysis of apps on the relationship of rating and reviews; analyze apps content by topic, price and find the answer which version of Android is most popular with users.
